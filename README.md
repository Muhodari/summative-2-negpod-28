**Summative-2-negpod-28**

To begin, clone the project using ```git clone```, in order to get everything in our project

Then move to the negpod-28_q1 directory: ```cd ./summative-2-negpod-28/negpod_28-q1```

Below I will explain the 4 main programs contained into this project: 


**1. The Student Registration:** this allows users to perform CRUD activities in the file containing a list of students:``` students-list_1023.txt```

To start the Student Registration Program type: ```./main.sh```. Upon starting, you will be prompted 5 options, and enter a number corresponding to your choice.

**Note**: Only the following data is recorded on a student: Unique student ID, Unique Student email, and Student age. To update or delete a student row, you need to know their ID.

**2.Student Email program** This helps users to save only the student emails in a separate file called student-emails.txt.

Note:To start this application, type: ```./select-emails.sh```

**3. Program for Auto-CD**;This program moves all files of the 2 programs said above to a new directory named **negpod_28-q1**. To start this Automation Program type: ```./move-to-directory.sh```

**4. Program to do backup** as a result,the entire system is backed up and kept in a folder named backup-negpod-28.



In the end start any of the applications mentioned above.
